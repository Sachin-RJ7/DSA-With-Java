//  https://leetcode.com/problems/find-peak-element/

//      About Question:

//      A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.
//      Given a 0-indexed integer array nums, find a peak element, and return its index.
//      If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to any of the peaks.
//      You may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -âˆž. In other words, an element is always considered
//      to be strictly greater than a neighbor that is outside the array.
//      You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.

//      Example :
//      Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
//      Output: 2
//      Explanation: 3 is a peak element and your function should return the index number 2.

        public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] arr = {0,10,5,2};
        System.out.println(peakIndexInMountainArray(arr));
    }

    public static int peakIndexInMountainArray(int[] arr) {
        int start = 0;
        int end = arr.length - 1;

        while (start < end) {
            int mid = start + (end - start) / 2;

            if (arr[mid] > arr[mid + 1]) {
                end = mid;
            }
            else {
                start = mid + 1;
